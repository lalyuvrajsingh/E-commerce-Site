# E-commerce-Site
This project is a Full-stack E-Commerce site, making this site with Next js, Tailwind CSS, Node js and using Strapi CMS for maintaining the products listing on the frontend. This will be one of my initial full-stack projects, I hope I try to use more of documentations and texts, and not tutorials as a help tool.
